# SafeSurf
SafeSurf:SafeSurf is a robust Chrome Extension tailored to safeguard organizational data by preventing access to harmful websites. It ensures that employees are protected from potential online threats, thereby reducing the risk of data loss and maintaining a secure browsing environment.


# KeyFeatures:

(i) Domain-Based Risk Recognition:

    Real-Time Protection: SafeSurf continuously monitors the websites employees visit and cross-references them with an up-to-date list of known harmful domains set by the administrator.

    Instant Blocking: If a website is identified as risky or malicious, SafeSurf immediately blocks access and displays a warning page, preventing any potential data breaches or security threats.

(ii) Centralized Malicious Site Catalog:

    Customizable Lists: Organizations can customize their own lists of blocked domains or update the existing catalog to include specific sites relevant to their security policies.

(iii) Improves Focus on Core Tasks:

    Blocking Non-Work-Related Sites: By preventing access to non-work-related or entertainment websites, SafeSurf helps employees stay focused on their tasks. This reduces the temptation to browse distracting sites, leading to improved productivity.

(iv) Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting:

     Once the threshold of five blocked domains is reached, the extension automatically sends a comprehensive report to the server, including the blocked website URLs, the employee's IP address, and a timestamp. This feature ensures that administrators have detailed insights into potential security incidents and can take timely action to maintain a secure browsing environment.

(v) Feedback and Reporting System:

    User Feedback Collection: Employees can submit feedback about blocked sites through an interactive popup form. This helps in identifying potential false positives and improving the block list.

    Feedback Storage: Collected feedback is stored securely and can be reviewed by administrators to refine the filtering process and address any concerns. 

(vi) User-Friendly Interface: 

    The extension features an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, making it simple for users to interact with and understand. Key features and notifications are presented clearly, ensuring that users can easily manage their browsing experience and stay informed about security measures without any hassle.
